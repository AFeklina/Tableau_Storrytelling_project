# Returns at the Superstore — Storytelling with Tableau

## Goal
This project explores **product returns in Superstore**, focusing on their growth over time, geographic distribution, customer behavior, and potential causes.

It was built as part of a storytelling exercise in Tableau, designed to walk stakeholders through key findings and drive business decisions.

## Key Findings

- **The number of returns has increased significantly in 2021**, especially in the **West region**.
- **California** stands out with both a high return rate and high return volume.
- **Return rates are not related to profit or total sales**, but closely **correlate with the number of orders**.
- **Some customers return nearly every order**, even when they place a large number of them.
- **A group of products** is returned more than 50% of the time, even when purchased 10+ times.
- **Return rates vary by day of the week and by time of year** — August is often a peak month, and Monday shows a suspiciously high return rate due to low purchase volume.

## Recommendations

🛠️ Based on the analysis, the following actions are proposed:

1. **Reevaluate return policies** in high-return states like California.
2. **Investigate customer-level behavior**, especially frequent returners with unusually high order volume.
3. **Assess product quality** for frequently returned items.
4. Consider **seasonal and weekday patterns** when planning promotions and return process optimizations.
